### Project Description
The idea behind our project is that it can automatically control lights in the room depending on the pressure sensors on the beds. Logic is simple: 
•	If there are no people on the beds -> turn light on.
•	If there is at least one person sleeping -> turn light off.
•	If everybody is sleeping and somebody steps on mat -> turn light on (intruder alert).
We have split the project in three parts which helped us to manage time efficiently and simplify each next step:
1.	Creating flow chart, logic circuit, and Boolean expressions.
2.	Creating a programming checklist based on the flow chart and logic circuit.
3.	Implementing an application in C++.
