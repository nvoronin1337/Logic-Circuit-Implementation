## C++ Implementation of Full-Service Welcome Mat Logic Circuit

##### Made by: Nikita Voronin, Eric Argenio, Trevor Ward

### Project Logic
The idea behind our project is that it can automatically control lights in the room depending on the pressure sensors on the beds. Logic is simple: 

  •	If there are no people on the beds -> turn light on.

  •	If there is at least one person sleeping -> turn light off.

  •	If everybody is sleeping and somebody steps on mat -> turn light on (intruder alert).
  
### Work Breakdown
We have split the project in three parts which helped us to manage time efficiently and simplify each next step:

  1.	Creating flow chart, logic circuit, and Boolean expressions.

  2.	Creating a programming checklist based on the flow chart and logic circuit.

  3.	Implementing an application in C++.
